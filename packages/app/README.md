1. If your local environment doesn't respect `.nvmrc` and switch node version automatically, you might get this error. 
```bash
error frontend-interview-takehome@1.0.0: The engine "node" is incompatible with this module. Expected version "^10.16.3". Got "xx.yy.zz"
```
Please install the corrent version and try again. Recommend to use [`nvm`](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to switch node version.
